Description: Software component index generator
 AppStream is a cross-distribution effort for providing and sharing
 metadata about software components available in the package repositories
 of a distribution.
 It provides specifications for an unified software component metadata database,
 screenshot services and various other things needed to make handling
 of software smarter. Also, the AppStream data allows building
 application-centric software management tools.
 .
 This package provides tools to generate, maintain and
 access the AppStream database of installed and available applications.
