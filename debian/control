Description: Software component metadata management
 AppStream is a metadata specification which permits software components to
 provide information about themselves to automated systems and end-users
 before the software is actually installed.
 The AppStream project provides facilities to easily access and transform
 this metadata, as well as a few additional services to allow building
 feature-rich software centers and similar applications.
 .
 This package provides tools to generate, maintain and query the AppStream
 data pool of installed and available software, and enables integration
 with the APT package manager.
 .
 The 'appstreamcli' tool can be used for accessing the software component
 pool as well as for working with AppStream metadata directly, including
 validating it for compliance with the specification.

Description: Compose metadata collections from directory trees
 AppStream is a metadata specification which permits software components to
 provide information about themselves to automated systems and end-users
 before the software is actually installed.
 This permits informative displays of new applications to users in software
 centers, as well as allowing a system to make decisions on which new software
 a user might want to install (e.g. missing firmware or media handlers).
 .
 This package extends the `appstreamcli` utility with a `compose` subcommand
 to generate AppStream metadata and media files from directory trees.
