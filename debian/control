Description: Software component metadata management
 AppStream is a metadata specification, allowing to write metadata for
 software projects in a standardized format.
 It provides facilities to easily access and transform the data, as well
 as a few additional services to allow building feature-rich software center
 applications.
 .
 This package provides tools to generate, maintain and query the AppStream
 data pool of installed and available software, and enables integration
 with the APT package manager.
 .
 The 'appstreamcli' tool can be used for accessing the software component
 pool as well as for working with AppStream metadata directly, including
 validating it for compliance with the specification.

Description: Library to access AppStream services
 AppStream is a metadata specification, allowing to write metadata for
 software projects in a standardized format. This allows software centers
 to display useful information for not installed software, as well as
 determining software the user might want to install (e.g. to open an
 unknown file type or to make missing firmware available).
 .
 This package contains a GObject-based library to access AppStream
 services, like the software component metadata pool.
 It also contains functions for reading, writing and transforming AppStream
 metadata.
