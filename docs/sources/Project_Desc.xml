		<title>What is AppStream?</title>

		<para>
			AppStream is a cross-distro effort for building Software-Center applications.
			It provides specifications for things like a screenshot-service, application ratings &amp; reviews etc.
			It also provides a Xapian database, storing information about all available applications in the distributionâ€™s repositories.
		</para>
		<para>
			All AppStream components are distro-agnostic (with exception to some metadata which is used to generate the Xapian application cache), and therefore
			AppStream makes it possible to build distro-agnostic application management tools.
