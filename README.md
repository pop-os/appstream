AppStream
=========

AppStream is a cross-distro effort for providing metadata for software in the (Linux) ecosystem. It provides a convenient way
to get information about not installed software, and is one of the building blocks for software centers.
It consists of specifications for things like upstream metainfo files, an unified software metadata pool for distributors,
screenshot services and various other useful bits needed to create user-friendly software-centers or other tools requiring
rich metadata for software and other content.

This repository contains:
 * the AppStream specification
 * the `appstreamcli` utility to access metadata, manipulate caches, show diagnostic information, etc. (see `man appstreamcli`)
 * a GLib/GObject based library for reading and writing AppStream metadata in XML and YAML, accessing the system data pool, and for various other useful methods.
 * a Qt5 based library for accessing AppStream.

### Dependencies

#### Required
 * cmake
 * glib2 (>= 2.36)
 * GObject-Introspection
 * libxml2
 * libyaml
 * ProtoBuf

#### Optional
 * Vala Compiler (vapigen) (for Vala VAPI file)
 * [Snowball](http://snowballstem.org/download.html) (for stemming support)

#### Documentation / Specification
 * Publican

#### Qt (for libappstream-qt)
 * Qt5 Core

### Build instructions

To compile AppStream, make sure that you have all required libraries (development files!) installed.
Then continue (the build system will complain about missing dependencies).

Use CMake to configure AppStream and build it with make:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake <flags> ..
make
make test
```
Possible AppStream-specific flags are:  
 -DQT=ON              -- Build the Qt5 interface library.  
 -DVAPI=ON            -- Build Vala API to use library with the Vala programming language.  
 -DDOCUMENTATION=ON   -- (Re)generate API documentation.  
 -DMAINTAINER=ON      -- Enable strict compiler options - use this if you write a patch for AppStream.  
 -DSTEMMING           -- Enable support for stemming in fulltext searches.  
 -DAPT_SUPPORT=ON     -- Enable integration with the APT package manager on Debian.

### Installation

To install the compiled binaries and required data, execute
`make install` with superuser permission.
